<h1>Open SDG features</h1>

Open SDG platforms are very customisable and there are a variety of optional features which can be easily configured.

## Multilingual
By default, the site is created in English (?). However, it is possible to change the default language of the site and make the site available in multiple languages.

An example of a site just using the English language (default) is the [UK site](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/).

An example of a site using multiple languages is the [Armenian site](https://armstat.github.io/sdg-site-armenia/).

## Maps
By default, data uploaded to an Open SDG platform is displayed on a chart and a table. You can configure your platform and data to also display data on a map.

Some examples of data being shown on maps are:

* 3.2.1 on Rwanda's Open SDG platform
* 3.c.1 on UK's Open SDG platform

For guidance on how set up your site and data in order to be able to display data on a map (as well as on a chart and table), see the [Maps page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maps/).

## Embedded content
Another way of showing data/information on a indicator page is by embedding content from other websites/applications.

Some examples of embedded content are:

* macro-economic dashboard embedded as main content on UK's Open SDG platform
* XX embedded on a tab on XX

Embedded features are configured in the metadata files. See the [*Embedded feature metadata* section on the Metadata format page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata-format/#embedded-feature-metadata) for more guidance.

## Targets on goal pages
By default, targets are not shown on the goal pages. An example of this is the [UK Open SDG platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/1/).

However, Open SDG platforms can be configured to show targets on the goal pages. An example of this is [Armenia's Open SDG platform](https://armstat.github.io/sdg-site-armenia/1/)

For guidance on how to display targets on your goal pages, see the [*Optional feature: Goal page layouts* section on the Customisations page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customisation/#optional-feature-goal-page-layouts).

## Reporting status options
By default, the reporting status options dispayed are **Complete**, **In progress** and **Exploring data sources**. However, these options can be changed to meet your needs. For example, options can be removed or another option, **Not applicable**, can be used.

An example of using the default options is [Ghana's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-ghana.github.io/reporting-status/).

An example of removing one of the options is the [UK's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/reporting-status/).

An example of using the **Not applicable** option is [Rwanda's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-rwanda.github.io/reporting-status/).

For guidance on how to change what reporting stasus options your site uses, see the [XX page]().

## Contrast button
By default, two buttons show to allow you to toggle between different contrast levels - the [US site](https://sdg.data.gov/) is an example of using this option. However, you can choose to user a more accessible contrast toggle button - the [UK site](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/) is an example of using this option.

For guidance on how to use the more accessible contrast button, see the [*contrast_type* section on the Configuration page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#contrast_type).

## Add pages
By default, there are four pages which show in the menu bar: Reporting status, About, Guidance and FAQ.

An example of using just the four default menu items is [Kyrgyzstan's site](https://sdg-kyrgyzstan.github.io/open-sdg-site-starter/en/)

An example of menu items being added is [UK's site](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/)

Even though only four pages are linked to in the menu by default, there are other pages provided for use (e.g. Contacts, News) as well as the option to easily create your own pages.

For guidance on how to add more pages to the menu, see the [*menu* section of the Configuration page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#menu).

For guidance on how to create new pages, see [XX]().
