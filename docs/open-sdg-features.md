<h1>Open SDG features</h1>

Open SDG platforms are very customisable and there are a variety of optional features which can be easily configured.

## Maps
By default, data uploaded to an Open SDG platform is displayed on a chart and a table. You can configure your platform and data to also display data on a map.

Some examples of data being shown on maps are:

* 3.2.1 on Rwanda's Open SDG platform
* 3.c.1 on UK's Open SDG platform

For guidance on how set up your site and data in order to be able to display data on a map (as well as on a chart and table), see the [Maps page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maps/).

## Embedded content
Another way of showing data/information on a indicator page is by embedding content from other websites/applications.

Some examples of embedded content are:

* macro-economic dashboard embedded as main content on UK's Open SDG platform
* XX embedded on a tab on XX

Embedded features are configured in the metadata files. See the [*Embedded feature metadata* section on the Metadata format page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata-format/#embedded-feature-metadata) for more guidance.

## Targets on goal pages
By default, targets are not shown on the goal pages. An example of this is the [UK Open SDG platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/1/).

However, Open SDG platforms can be configured to show targets on the goal pages. An example of this is [Armenia's Open SDG platform](https://armstat.github.io/sdg-site-armenia/1/)

For guidance on how to display targets on your goal pages, see the [*Optional feature: Goal page layouts* section on the Customisations page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customisation/#optional-feature-goal-page-layouts).

## Reporting status options
By default, the reporting status options dispayed are **Complete**, **In progress** and **Exploring data sources**. However, these options can be changed to meet your needs. For example, options can be removed or another option, **Not applicable**, can be used.

An example of using the default options is [Ghana's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-ghana.github.io/reporting-status/).

An example of removing one of the options is the [UK's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/reporting-status/).

An example of using the **Not applicable** option is [Rwanda's Reporting status page](https://sustainabledevelopment-rwanda.github.io/reporting-status/).

For guidance on how to change what reporting stasus options your site uses, see the [XX page]().

## Contrast button
By default, two buttons show to allow you to toggle between different contrast levels - the [US site](https://sdg.data.gov/) is an example of using this option. However, you can choose to user a more accessible contrast toggle button - the [UK site](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/) is an example of using this option.

For guidance on how to use the more accessible contrast button, see the [*contrast_type* section on the Configuration page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#contrast_type).
