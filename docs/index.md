# Open SDG

This is the centerpiece of several repositories comprising a reporting platform for the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG). In addition to displaying SDG indicator data to the general public, this platform serves as a data management system. It is built with open-source libraries and tools, and can be hosted and maintained with free services.
