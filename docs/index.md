# Open SDG

[Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) is a reporting platform for the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG). In addition to displaying SDG indicator data to the general public, this platform serves as a data management system. It is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools, and can be hosted and maintained using only free services.

Under the hood, Open SDG relies on two other projects:

* [SDG Build](https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-build)
* [SDG Translations](https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-translations)
