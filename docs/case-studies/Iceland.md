## Why was Open SDG chosen?

We initially learned of the SDG platform during an offical visit from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) to Statistics Iceland. We quickly recognized the benefits of using a National Reporting Platform for reporting SDG statistics as compared to traditional means of reporting SDG data. Of the NRPs that we surveyed we found the Open SDG platform to have the most concise and clear presention of data and the most transparent presentation of metadata. The open source nature of the platform was also very beneficial for us at a small statistical office with little means for extensive web development.

## Which organisation was responsible for choosing and implementing the platform?

Statistics Iceland (Hagstof √çslands)
The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)

## How did you set up your country platform based on Open SDG?

We followed the quick start instructions, forked the British website and made all necessary adjustments on this basis. Afterwards, the data and metadata were uploaded and translations were implemented.

## How long did it take to set up the platform?

In fact, it took quite a long time from the fork of the NRP to the release, but this had nothing to do with technical difficulties.

## How do you upload data and metadata into the platform?

Data is taken from our internal database and converted into the required CSV format. Metadata is changed directly in the md-files. md- and csv files are then pushed into the corresponding GitHub repositories

## How is the platform hosted? (GitHub, local server, other platform)

The platform is hosted on Statistics Iceland local servers, the data however is hosted on GitHub

## How are support and maintenance managed for the platform?

Statistics Iceland performs all platform maintenance for translations, content updates, data and metadata updates.

## What languages is your platform available in?

English and Icelandic

## What customisations were added to the Open SDG platform?

No custumisations have been added to the Open SDG platform yet.

## What advice and lessons learned could you give to other countries considering using Open SDG?

Open SDG offers the opportunity to create a great reporting platform with comparatively little effort. Due to the various wikis and the great support of the Open SDG team it was possible for us to create the site even without deep IT knowledge and only by learning-by-doing.
